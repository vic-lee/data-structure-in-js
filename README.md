# Data Structures in JavaScript 

This is an implementation of things taught in CSCI-UA 102 (primarily data structures and sorting algorithms) in JavaScript. Selected files are also implemented in TypeScript, for me to better understand type enforcements in TypeScript. This project is created for self reference purposes.
